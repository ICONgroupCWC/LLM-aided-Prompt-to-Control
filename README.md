# LLM-aided Human-Robot Interfacing for A Prompt-to-Control Application
This repository demonstrates a project focused on enhancing human-robot interaction by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding. This approach enables seamless communication between non-expert users and autonomous robots, allowing human operators to issue freeform prompts without needing specialized knowledge or machine-readable commands.

By deploying an LLM-based architecture, the system translates human intent into structured instructions for the robot, defining three key parameters:

- **Go Where?** - Specifies the robot's destination.
- **Find What?** - Identifies objects or items to locate.
- **Do What?** - Outlines the intended action at the destination.

The resulting command, known as the DOA tuple `(destination: D, object: O, action: A)`, is shared with the robot, which then autonomously navigates to the destination and performs real-time object recognition and task execution. This solution simplifies human-robot communication, making robotic operations more accessible and adaptable in real-world applications.

### Hardware
- Jetbot ROS Ai kit ​
- Server Computer

### Software and frameworks​
- Opencv​
- Robot Operating System​ (ROS)
## Hardware Configuration
In this section, we will outline the setup process for the hardware components. The demo setup includes a robot, one server computer, and a wifi router. Let's delve into the specifics of setting up this hardware configuration.
### Jetbot robot
The robot we’re using here is based on the JetBot ROS AI Kit and runs on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It has a 360-degree LiDAR sensor in the middle to help it "see" around itself, along with a RealSense D415 depth camera for object detection. For step-by-step setup details, you can check out the official [JetBot ROS AI Kit page](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/JetBot_ROS_AI_Kit).

To install the RealSense SDK, download it from Intel’s website  [here](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/nvidia-jetson-tx2-installation) and follow their setup guide.

For OpenCV, use the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install opencv-python
```
To set up the TurtleBot3 ROS packages, follow the instructions on the TurtleBot3 [official page](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#overview).

To install NVIDIA TensorRT on Jetbot robot , follow the official installation guide provided by NVIDIA [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/install-guide/index.html).

Once you’ve installed all dependencies, download this repository, then copy the `llm_autonomous` and `object_detection` folders into your ROS workspace. After that, go into your workspace and build it with the following commands:
```
cd ~/<ros_workspace>/
catkin_make
source ~/<ros_workspace>/devel/setup.bash
```
### Server 
The server is an Ubuntu OS running machine equipped with ROS (Robot Operating System).To set up the Server, download this GitHub repository and copy the `chat_project` folder into your workspace. After that, run the following commands to install the required dependencies and set up the database:

- Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the Django migrations to set up the database:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
